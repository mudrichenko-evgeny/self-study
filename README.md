# Self-study
Self-study is a quiz app that tracks your learning progress. The user answers a series of questions (via text or voice), then checks the correctness of the answer himself. The app keeps statistics and can ask understudied questions first. The user can create, import and edit their own question packs.
<h3>Areas of use:</h3>

- Learning foreign words;
- Learning any material in a question-answer format;
- Practicing pronunciation through tongue-twisters. The user is prompted to record a tongue-twister through a voice recorder and then check the quality of pronunciation.
